# Operations

## Operational Readiness Checklist
- [ ] On-call ownership defined.
- [ ] SLOs and alert thresholds defined.
- [ ] Dashboards for latency/errors/throughput are live.
- [ ] Runbooks linked for all Sev1/Sev2 alerts.
- [ ] Rollback plan validated.
- [ ] Capacity guardrails documented.

## Deployment Model
Describe the operational runtime model, scheduling, and system deployment architecture.

## Service Level Objectives
| SLI | SLO Target | Measurement Window | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Availability | 99.9% | 30d | TBD |
| P95 latency | TBD | 7d | TBD |
| Error rate | < 1% | 7d | TBD |

## Monitoring
| Signal | Metric | Threshold | Alert |
|---|---|---|---|
| Traffic | requests/sec | baseline drift | warn |
| Latency | p95/p99 | threshold breach | page |
| Reliability | error ratio | threshold breach | page |
| Saturation | cpu/memory/queue depth | sustained high | page |

## Health Checks
- Liveness:
- Readiness:
- Dependency health:
- Synthetic transaction:

## Incident Response
- Detection:
- Triage:
- Mitigation:
- Communication:
- Post-mortem:

## Rollout Strategy
- Blue/green deployment:
- Canary release:
- Rolling update:
- Feature flags:

## Capacity Planning
- Traffic patterns:
- Resource utilization:
- Scaling triggers:

## Logging
Use `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` with structured JSON output and request correlation ids.

## Secrets Management
| Secret | Source | Rotation | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| External service auth material | managed runtime configuration | periodic | runtime services |
| Artifact signing material | managed signing service/local secure store | periodic | release pipeline |

## Security Testing
| Test Type | Cadence | Tooling |
|---|---|---|
| SAST | each PR | language linters/scanners |
| Dependency scan | each PR + weekly | supply-chain tools |
| DAST/pentest | scheduled | external/internal |

## Compliance and Audit
- Regulatory scope:
- Audit evidence location:
- Exception process:

## Pre-Promotion Security Checklist
- [ ] Threat model updated for changed surfaces.
- [ ] Auth/authz tests pass.
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan reviewed.
- [ ] No unresolved critical/high security findings.
