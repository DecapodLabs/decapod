# Intent

## Product Outcome
- A daemonless control plane for AI coding agents.

## Inferred Baseline
- Repository: decapod
- Product type: service_or_library
- Primary languages: rust
- Detected surfaces: cargo

## Scope
- In scope for decapod:
- Out of scope:

## Constraints
- Technical:
- Operational:
- Security/compliance:

## Acceptance Criteria (must be objectively testable)
- [ ] Decapod validate passes, required tests pass, and promotion-relevant artifacts are present.
- [ ] Non-functional targets are met (latency, reliability, cost, etc.).
- [ ] Validation gates pass and artifacts are attached.

## First Implementation Slice
- [ ] Define the smallest user-visible workflow to ship first.
- [ ] Define what data/contracts are required for that workflow.
- [ ] Define what is intentionally postponed until v2.

## Open Questions
- List unresolved decisions that block implementation confidence.
