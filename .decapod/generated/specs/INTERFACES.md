# Interfaces

## Contract Principles
- Prefer explicit schemas over implicit behavior.
- Every mutating interface defines idempotency semantics.
- Every failure path maps to a typed, documented error code.

## Generated Contract Depth
Generated interface specs should include:
- API/CLI contracts with request/response schemas.
- Read/write ownership for each storage path.
- Idempotency and retry behavior for mutations.
- Typed failure classes and recovery instructions.

## API / RPC Contracts
| Interface | Method | Request Schema | Response Schema | Errors | Idempotency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` |

## Event Consumers
| Consumer | Event | Ordering Requirement | Retry Policy | DLQ Policy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` |

## Outbound Dependencies
| Dependency | Purpose | SLA | Timeout | Circuit-Breaker |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` | `TODO` |

## Inbound Contracts
- API / RPC entrypoints:
- CLI surfaces:
- Event/webhook consumers:
- Repository-detected surfaces: cargo

## Data Ownership
- Source-of-truth tables/collections:
- Cross-boundary read models:
- Consistency expectations:

## Error Taxonomy Example (cli)
```rust
#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]
pub enum ApiError {
    #[error("validation failed: {0}")]
    Validation(String),
    #[error("upstream timeout")]
    UpstreamTimeout,
    #[error("conflict: {0}")]
    Conflict(String),
}
```

## Failure Semantics
| Failure Class | Retry/Backoff | Client Contract | Observability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Validation | No retry | 4xx typed error | warn log + metric |
| Dependency timeout | Exponential backoff | 503 with retryable code | error log + alert |
| Conflict | Conditional retry | 409 with conflict detail | info log + metric |

## Timeout Budget
| Hop | Budget (ms) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Client -> Edge/API | 500 | Includes auth + routing |
| API -> Domain | 300 | Includes validation |
| Domain -> Store/Dependency | 200 | Includes retry overhead |

## Interface Versioning
- Version strategy (`v1`, date-based, semver):
- Backward-compatibility guarantees:
- Deprecation window and removal policy:

## Governed Phase Gates
- `decapod govern plan phase add` persists ordered phase contracts. Identical declarations are idempotent; conflicting duplicates and unknown TODO references are rejected.
- `phase enter` requires the next incomplete phase and evaluates entry gates. `phase complete` requires the active phase and evaluates exit gates.
- Artifact gates are existence proof only at evaluation time. Verified-TODO gates require a current Decapod verification record and are evidence proof.
- Plan mutations use a bounded cross-process lock plus atomic rename. A phase-bearing plan cannot execute work without an active phase or enter `DONE` before every phase is terminal.
- Stable automation markers: `PHASE_GATE_FAILED`, `PHASE_EXIT_GATE_FAILED`, `INVALID_PHASE_TRANSITION`, `INVALID_PHASE_COMPLETION`, `PHASE_LOCKED`, `INVALID_PHASE_CONTRACT`.
