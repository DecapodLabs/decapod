## What This Project Is
decapod is a cli project built using Rust.
cli

Architectural principles:
- **Simplicity**: Keep components focused and reusable.
- **Modularity**: Clearly defined interface boundaries and dependency separation.
- **Reliability**: Graceful failure handling and thorough verification.

## Current Facts
- Runtime/languages: Rust
- Detected surfaces/framework hints: cargo
- Product type: cli

## Architecture Map
This project's architecture consists of the following key layers/directories:
- `src/`: Main source directory containing primary logic.
- `tests/`: Integration and unit test suite.

## Data Flows
- Inbound request/command parses and validates at the entrypoint.
- Core runtime handles business logic and initiates queries or state changes.
- Storage adapter reads or writes data to the underlying persistence layers.

## Strongest Existing Primitives
- Define the strongest existing primitives in the codebase (e.g., helper utilities, base controllers, data access layers).

  U[User] --> C[CLI Entrypoint]
  C --> R[Command Router]
  R --> E[Core Engine]
  E --> S[(Local Store)]
  E --> X[External APIs / Filesystem]
```

## Store Boundaries

  C --> R[(Read Store)]
```

## Happy Path Sequence
```mermaid

  participant U as User
  participant C as CLI
  participant E as Core Engine
  participant S as Store
  U->>C: Run command
  C->>E: Parse + validate
  E->>S: Persist mutation
  S-->>E: Ack
  E-->>C: Result
  C-->>U: Structured output
```

## Error Path
```mermaid

  participant Client
  participant Service
  participant Store
  Client->>Service: Request
  Service->>Store: Database Query
  Store--xService: Error/Timeout
  Service-->>Client: Typed Error / Recovery Instructions
```

## Execution Path
- Ingress parse + validation:
- Policy/interlock checks:
- Core execution + persistence:
- Verification and artifact emission:

## Concurrency and Runtime Model
- Execution model:
- Isolation boundaries:
- Backpressure strategy:
- Shared state synchronization:

## Deployment Topology
- Runtime units:
- Region/zone model:
- Rollout strategy (blue/green/canary):
- Rollback trigger and blast-radius scope:

## Data and Contracts
- Inbound contracts (CLI/API/events):
- Outbound dependencies (datastores/queues/external APIs):
- Data ownership boundaries:
- Schema evolution + migration policy:

## ADR Register
| ADR | Title | Status | Rationale | Date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADR-001 | Initial topology choice | Proposed | Define first stable architecture | YYYY-MM-DD |

## Delivery Plan (first 3 slices)
- Slice 1 (ship first):
- Slice 2:
- Slice 3:

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Contract drift across components | Medium | High | Spec + schema checks in CI |
| Runtime saturation under peak load | Medium | High | Capacity model + load tests |
