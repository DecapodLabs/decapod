## Why Decapod 🧠

AI coding agents can write code fast. Shipping it safely is the hard part.

Decapod gives agents a consistent operational contract: guided execution, enforceable boundaries, and auditable completion signals. It replaces "looks done" with explicit outcomes.

Decapod is **invoked by agents; it never runs in the background**. It is a single executable binary that provides deterministic primitives:
- Retrieve **canon (constitution .md fragments)** as context.
- Provide authoritative schemas for **structured state** (todos, knowledge, decisions).
- Run deterministic **validation/proof gates** to decide when work is truly done.

Traces are stored locally in `.decapod/data/traces.jsonl`. Bindings are introspectable via `context.bindings`.

Decapod is architecture-agnostic software. It is not a Linux kernel binding and is not coupled to a specific OS or CPU architecture.

## Assurance Model ✅

Decapod is built around three execution outcomes:

- `Advisory`: guidance toward the next high-value move.
- `Interlock`: hard stops for unsafe or out-of-policy flow.
- `Attestation`: structured evidence that completion criteria were met.

## Operating Model ⚙️

```text
Human Intent
    |
    v
AI Agent(s)  <---->  Decapod Runtime  <---->  Repository + Policy
                         |    |    |
                         |    |    +-- Interlock (enforced boundaries)
                         |    +------- Advisory (guided execution)
                         +------------ Attestation (verifiable outcomes)
```

## Features ✨

- Agent-native CLI and RPC surface for deterministic operation.
- Guided project understanding through structured prompting.
- Standards-aware execution aligned with project policy.
- Workspace safety for isolated implementation flow.
- Validation and completion gates with explicit pass/fail outcomes.
- Multi-agent-ready orchestration surface for tooling integrations.

## Getting Started 🚀

Install Decapod with Cargo, initialize it in your repository, and let your agent operate through the Decapod contract instead of direct ad-hoc repo mutation.

For command details and full usage, use `decapod --help`.
