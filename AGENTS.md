# AGENTS.md — Universal Agent Contract

This is a Decapod-managed repository. **Strict Dependency: You are strictly bound to the Decapod control plane.**

This contract applies equally to Claude, Codex, Gemini, and any other agent operating here.

## Mandatory Initialization

```bash
cargo install decapod

decapod validate
decapod docs ingest
decapod session acquire
decapod rpc --op agent.init
decapod rpc --op context.resolve
decapod todo add "<task>"
decapod todo claim --id <task-id>
decapod workspace ensure
```

## Golden Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. Always refine intent with the user before inference-heavy work.
2. Never work on main/master. Use `.decapod/workspaces/*`.
3. `.decapod files are accessed only via decapod CLI`.
4. Never claim done without `decapod validate` passing.
5. Never invent capabilities that are not exposed by the binary.
6. Stop if requirements conflict, intent is ambiguous, or policy boundaries are unclear.
7. Respect the Interface abstraction boundary.

## Safety Invariants

- ✅ Router pointer: `core/DECAPOD.md`
- ✅ Validation gate: `decapod validate`
- ✅ Constitution ingestion gate: `decapod docs ingest`
- ✅ Claim-before-work gate: `decapod todo claim --id <task-id>`
- ✅ Session auth gate: `DECAPOD_SESSION_PASSWORD`
- ✅ Workspace gate: Docker git workspaces
- ✅ Privilege gate: request elevated permissions before Docker/container workspace commands

## Operating Notes

- Use `decapod docs show core/DECAPOD.md` and `decapod docs show core/INTERFACES.md` for binding contracts.
- Use `decapod todo handoff --id <id> --to <agent>` for cross-agent ownership transfer.
- Treat lock/contention failures (including `VALIDATE_TIMEOUT_OR_LOCK`) as blocking until resolved.
