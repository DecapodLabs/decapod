## 1. Methodology Guides

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `methodology/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Architectural tradeoff and design workflow practice |
| `methodology/SOUL.md` | Agent identity and collaboration style |
| `methodology/KNOWLEDGE.md` | Knowledge curation practice |
| `methodology/MEMORY.md` | Memory hygiene and retrieval practice |
| `architecture/UI.md` | UI architecture patterns and component design |

## 2. Boundary Rule

Methodology guides are non-binding.
Binding rules live in `specs/` and `interfaces/`.

## 3. Extraction Status

- `interfaces/TESTING.md`
- `core/EMERGENCY_PROTOCOL.md`
